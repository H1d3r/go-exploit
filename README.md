# go-exploit: Go Exploit Framework

[![Go](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/actions/workflows/go.yml) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit)

`go-exploit` is an exploit development framework for [Go](https://go.dev/). The framework helps exploit developers create small, self-contained, portable, and consistent exploits. The framework was developed to simplify large scale scanning, exploitation, and integration with other tools. For API documentation, check out the package on [pkg.go.dev/github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit).
## Features

The framework includes the following features:


* [Three step attack chain](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#exploit-skeleton): target verification, [version scanning](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/version-checking.md), and exploitation. The phases can be chained or executed independently.
* [Auto-detection](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/scanning.md#autodetect-ssl) of SSL/TLS on the remote target.
* Fully [proxy-aware](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/scanning.md#Proxy).
* Key-value or JSON [output](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/output.md) for easy integration into other automated systems.
* Builtin Java [gadgets](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/java/javagadget.go), [classes](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/java/javaclass.go), and [LDAP](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/java/ldapjndi/ldapjndi.go) infrastructure.
* Many [reverse shell](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/payload/reverse), [dropper](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/tree/main/payload/dropper), and [bind shell](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/payload/bindshell) payloads.
* Functionality that integrates exploitation with other [tools](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/c2.md#using--o) or frameworks like [Metasploit](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/c2.md#using-httpservefile) and Sliver.
* Builtin ["c2"](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/c2.md) for catching encrypted/unencrypted shells or hosting implants.
* Supports multipe target [formats](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/go-exploit/blob/main/docs/scanning.md#providing-targets) including lists, file-based, VulnCheck IP-Intel, and more.

## Examples

* [CVE-2023-22527](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/cve-2023-22527): Three go-exploit implementations taking unique approaches to Atlassian Confluence CVE-2023-22527.
* [CVE-2023-51467](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/cve-2023-51467): A go-exploit implementation of CVE-2023-51467 that lands a Nashorn reverse shell.
* [CVE-2023-33246](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/fetch-broker-conf): A go-exploit implementation to hunt for RocketMQ broker configuration IoC. See the [VulnCheck blog](https://vulncheck.com/blog/rocketmq-exploit-payloads).
* [IOS-XE Implant Scanner](https://github.com/vulncheck-oss/cisco-ios-xe-implant-scanner): A scanner for the Cisco IOS XE CVE-2023-20198 implant.
