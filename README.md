# go-exploit

`go-exploit` is an exploit development framework for [Go](https://go.dev/). The framework helps exploit developers create small, self-contained, portable, and consistent exploits.

Many proof-of-concept exploits rely on interpreted languages with complicated packaging systems, use wildly differing user interfaces, and have limited ability to be executed within a target network. On the other hand, some exploits are integrated into massive frameworks with numerous dependencies, which can overwhelm the developer and hinder the attacker's ability to deploy the exploit effectively.

To address these issues, `go-exploit` provides a lightweight framework with minimal dependencies, written in a language that can be easily cross-compiled to different operating systems and architectures. The framework is user-friendly for quick proof-of-concept development while also being sophisticated enough for operational use. Exploits developed using `go-exploit` can be compiled into single stand-alone executables, eliminating the burden of unnecessary features and tactics.
