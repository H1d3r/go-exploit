# Scanning Multiple Hosts

`go-exploit` exploits can be used for scanning multiple hosts and ports. On the command line, exploits support `-rhosts` and `-rports`. At the time of writing, these are both comma delimited lists (although CIDR and file support should exist in the not too distant future).

The following example below scans multiple host/port combinations looking for Webmin targets:

```sh
albinolobster@mournland:~/go-exploit/examples/cve-2019-15107$ ./cve-2019-15107 -rhosts 10.9.49.174,10.9.49.205 -rports 80,10000 -a -v
[*] Starting target 0: 10.9.49.174:80
[*] Validating the remote target is a Webmin installation
[-] HTTP request error: Get "http://10.9.49.174:80/": dial tcp 10.9.49.174:80: connect: connection refused
[-] The target isn't recognized as Webmin, quitting
[*] Starting target 1: 10.9.49.174:10000
[*] Validating the remote target is a Webmin installation
[+] Target validation succeeded!
[*] Starting target 2: 10.9.49.205:80
[*] Validating the remote target is a Webmin installation
[-] The HTTP header doesn't appear to be Webmin
[-] The target isn't recognized as Webmin, quitting
[*] Starting target 3: 10.9.49.205:10000
[*] Validating the remote target is a Webmin installation
[-] HTTP request error: Get "http://10.9.49.205:10000/": dial tcp 10.9.49.205:10000: connect: connection refused
[-] The target isn't recognized as Webmin, quitting
```

Note that `-a` is useful when using `rhosts` or `rports` because it will autodiscover if the target supports SSL.
